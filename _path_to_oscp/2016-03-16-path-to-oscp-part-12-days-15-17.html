excerpt: I have 13 days left in the labs. I am still feeling quite confident - whether this is foolhardy or not, we'll see at the start of April.

<p>This is a quick one.</p>
<p>Update on the loot:</p>
<ul>
<li>13 rooted machines</li>
<li>1 new unlocked network</li>
<li>1 dual-homed system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My exam date is 1st April at 12 noon local time</strong>.</p>
<p>I was supposed to be doing only documentation tonight, but I wanted to run 'just a few scans' from inside the new network and one thing led to another and I ended up kindly RTFM-ing <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/">Metasploit Unleashed</a> and was able to root one of the earlier low priv shells. That was actually the <em>second</em> machine that I was able to get from low priv to root by just following my notes and reading the manual. <em>Le sigh</em> as we say.</p>
<p>Other than having to underline how bloody brilliant MSUnleashed is as a source material, I can recommend, still, that VulnHub VMs and CTFs are the best pre-course prep you can have. Going through the motions of hacking challenges or boot2root VMs gives you the practice of typing the commands and getting used to the tools.</p>
<p>My post-exploitation skills are still abhorrently slow. I need to make more and more things automated so if I have a short-lived shell I can have a shot at getting persistence through msf. If I am there going 'hummmm I wonder what the param for hostname was' then I'm going to just shoot myself in the foot.</p>
<p>So. Go check out the <a href="http://localhost.exposed/2016/02/22/vlog-path-to-oscp-part-3/">links I have in part 3</a> and go visit e.g. <a href="http://ctftime.org">ctftime.org</a> to get into the world of CTFs.</p>
<p>Now I need to get back to looting my newly rooted machines for pivots, secrets and funny cat photos!</p>
