<p>Day 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>4,5 hours study</li>
<li>1:52 min videos</li>
<li>33% done of the written materials</li>
<li>One epic boss level found (Sufference)</li>
<li>Some real-world actionable intel</li>
<li>Looooooots of lab recon</li>
</ul>
<p>Decided to go with KeepNote for work-in-progress note taking and once I am done with a machine then I'll document it in the pentest report as it is still fresh in my mind.</p>
