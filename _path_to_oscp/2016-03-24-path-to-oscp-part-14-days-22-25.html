<ul>
<li>5 days of labs left
<ul>
<li>incl. 1 full weekend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>8 days till exam</li>
<li>22 machines done</li>
<li>2/3 network secretsÂ unlocked</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting stuff I found during this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/Pentesting_VOIP">BackTrack Linux Wiki: Pentesting VOIP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://superuser.com/a/284147/121460">How to use BITS for downloading on command line</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/">Online disassembler</a> for checking your payloads (found previously, forgot to link)</li>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/149648">I learnt that you can open Control Panel parts from cmd line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With that out of the way, time to hack!</p>
<p>Next post - as said in the video - will probably be around the last lab day to update on what was the final score from 30d labs. And then the next one for D-Day in some form or another.</p>
