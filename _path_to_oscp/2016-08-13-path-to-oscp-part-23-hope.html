<p>This post is going to be brief.</p>
<p>Exam done. Got 3 hrs of sleep. Sent my reports 30 minutes ago.</p>
<p>Got 60 solid points and then unknown points for a low priv + lab/exercise reports. The latter should max out at 5+5 if I didn't screw up anything in the reports. I have no idea what a low priv is worth.</p>
<p>But I am very, very, very hopeful that those combined should net me a positive result.</p>
<p>Certain? Nope. I wish I could've escalated that machine to gain a sure pass.</p>
<p>BUT there is a chance!</p>
<p>(I asked my wife whether the thumbnail photo was 'too derpy' or 'just derpy enough' given the giddiness I experienced during the root of that last machine I got -- she assured me it is just the right amount of <em>derp</em>)</p>
