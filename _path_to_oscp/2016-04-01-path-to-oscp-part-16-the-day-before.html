<p>I managed to finish the lab report. You might think <em>it ain't exactly a miracle</em> and I would agree with you. BUT. For some reason I had a really hard time trying to get my mind focus on the documentation as I started of with the PWK Lab Report template that had plenty of pre-filled text as boilerplate to show what is expected of a good report.</p>
<p>For some reason the wording, structure and overall form just didn't fit with my own way of organizing my thoughts so I had a tough time getting to it. After a few hours of struggling I decided to switch to our company's blank Word template and copied the structure of a recent(ish) security audit I have done.</p>
<p>This familiar structure and form made it a lot more approachable and I was able to plough through the documentation in almost one go with the aid of some hard bpm tunes.</p>
<p>Since then I have been crafting my game plan for tomorrow as I am expecting a definite <em>deer in headlights</em> moments when I start. So I will just run the first hour on auto-pilot with the plan I have come up with.</p>
<p>My current schedule looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-695" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ss-2016-03-31-at-21-12-02.jpg" alt="ss 2016-03-31 at 21.12.02" width="208" height="286" /></p>
<p>I am still torn between whether I should follow this schedule tightly as not to slip into a 4-hour long tunnelvision trip down the deep rabbit holes as I have done on several nights in the labs. Obviously I cannot know what I am doing tomorrow at 14:30 and whether I am in a good spot to have a break. That is of course the tricky part as I doubt that there will be many 'good spots' during the exam to <em>not</em> be hacking away.</p>
<p>23 hours and 45 mins to do the exam. Then another 24 hours for the documentation deadline (given that I have enough machines breached).</p>
<p>Out of that exam time I am currently planning on devoting 3 hours for breaks/food and 4 hours for sleep. I expect to be mentally shredded after the exam ends. We'll see.</p>
<p>For the past 3 days I have mostly been focusing my learning on these sites (old and new):</p>

<p>Oh and please, if you have any tips for the exam besides 'take breaks and follow your plan' do not share any specifics you know or have heard online. I do not want the slightest sliver of doubt in my mind or anyone else's mind that if I pass that I have done this 100% on my own. I understand that it might be out of the kindness of your heart, but giving anything except very very generic advice is just very shady territory right now before my exam.</p>
