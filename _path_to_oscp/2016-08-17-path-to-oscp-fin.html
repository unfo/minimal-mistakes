<p>Doing some coding in Go or Rust - Need to keep my developer brain happy/activated.</p>
<p><em>But first:</em><br />
- Recuperating from the exertion<br />
- Find the sweetspot for hours/week for learning stuff vs relationships and mental exhaustion</p>

<h3>Part 2: How to prepare for OSCP</h3>

<p>That's it.</p>
<p>This concludes my Path to OSCP since I have achieved that goal. I will most probably do a <em>Path to OSCE</em> when it is its time and will let y'all know through this blog, twitter, youtube and linkedin.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile you will probably see an increasing amount of links and posts here on reverse engineering. I might do some videos on the subject later on once I figure out a good format for that since it is not a directed curriculum as the PWK/OSCP was.</p>
<p>I could do another Q&amp;A episode as an appendix to this series if there is interest / more questions that you want me to answer.</p>
