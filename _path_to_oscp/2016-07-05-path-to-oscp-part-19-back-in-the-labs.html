<h1>I'm back!</h1>
<p>Oh boy, it feels good to be back.</p>
<p>I got back home last night (22 hrs ago) and I got my renewed lab access 12 hours later.</p>
<p>So far I have spent my time on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this 'en map' you speak of</li>
<li>Dear lord, so many machines!</li>
<li>Okay, I can do this. Let's start by rechecking all previously owned machines</li>
<li>WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T INSTALL PARALLELS TOOLS!</li>
<li>And what do YOU mean you can't find CPU0 DEVICE NODE?!</li>
<li>Oh sweet! First root! (and second, and third and fourth)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, it is quite intimidating coming back after my own failure and seeing people who've started after me be already OSCP certified.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many folks who've told me they also failed their first or second exam whilst I was away. Thanks for those messages, they eased this comeback :)</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's the latest vlog entry.</p>
