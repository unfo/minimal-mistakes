## [Firmware flaw finding fucks-up friends and foes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/wifi-firmware-bug-affects-laptops-smartphones-routers-gaming-devices/)

> The researcher says the firmware function to scan for new WiFi networks launches automatically every five minutes, making exploitation trivial. All an attacker has to do is send malformed WiFi packets to any device with a Marvell Avastar WiFi chipset and wait until the function launches, to execute malicious code and take over the device.

So. Trivial exploit over the air.. But surely it's not a widely-used product... right?

## [Mitre releases initial study of how different EDR products fare against their ATT&amp;CK framework](https://attackevals.mitre.org/evaluations.html)

Given that the Mitre ATT&CK framework is a fairly good way to map different attack paths and vectors, I really like the effort they have put into modelling different EDR products based on what they can detect.

imho this should be done by the vendors themselves as well. No false advertizing fuckery mind you.

## [SpecterOps finds local priv-esc via lax service path permissions](https://posts.specterops.io/razer-synapse-3-elevation-of-privilege-6d2802bd0585)

This is one of those things that is almost a constant when doing Windows host assessments. Things related to builtin components from MS are really robust, so third party vendors are your biggest increase in local attack surface.

SpecterOps - whose Red Team training I participated last year - has a really good blog post about a local priv-esc vulnerability caused by improper directory permissions that effectively allows a low-privileged user to overwrite a registered service's executable.

One fun thing you can do on your own system at home is to run [PowerSploit/PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) and see what results you get, as it automates the tedious service and path checks.

**Caveat emptor** as with all tools, you need to understand the results before you take any action. Most common false positive from it relates to a seemingly modifiable `C:\` folder which could in some cases mean you could hijack services under `c:\program files\` by having `program.exe` at the root of `C:\`. Most commonly on modern installations this attack vector doesn't work. So *check yo'self before yo' wreck yo'self*.
